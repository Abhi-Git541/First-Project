# First-Project
This is my first project to learn more about git and github.
1. Create your Github Account and create your repository which I have named as 'First_Project'. Add gitignore file as python, add license as Apache and add readme file also.
2. Download VS Code
3. Download Git CLI
4. After installing everything, open vs code and clone that repository using link in code button in the github repository.
5. Create a requirements.txt file in the project section and install it using a command in terminal
''' pip install -r requirements.txt '''
6. Then run your python file. Since streamlit use this command to run it
''' streamlit run d:/TVS/Abhishek/Projects/First-Project/Weather.py ''' 
7. To update everything on github use these commands
-git status
-git add .
-git add file names
-git commit -m "comments"
-git push origin main
after these commands everything will be updated in the github repository.
